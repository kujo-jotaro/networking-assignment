# networking-assignment

This is my attempt to recreate BSD-style [sockets](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html)

## Motivation

This was first proposed as an assignment by my programming prof at UNRN. I eventually abandoned the idea, since I was moving.
Nowadays it's just a challenge to myself.
